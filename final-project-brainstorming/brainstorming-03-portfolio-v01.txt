For the portfolio page I really want to include a project that im currently
creating that involves an arduino, cardboard, and some paint(creating a prototype
using an arduino and using items from home to assemble them. Also very excited to 
share this). Possibly a website that I made in one of my other classes in case 
this page is too empty.
