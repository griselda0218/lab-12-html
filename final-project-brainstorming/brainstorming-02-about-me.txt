At the moment, I want to indugle myself into technology in the creative aspect
such as animation, game design, and physical computation(modeling prototypes). 
I feel like my creativity skills are something that Im confident in, I find myself 
to be artistic in many ways and so I would really want to incorporate my art into 
technology. Im keeping an open mind about what my future plans will be, I want to
remain open to anything and learn more.
